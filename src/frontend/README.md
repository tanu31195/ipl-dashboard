## Hash Router
Used to route when spring boot app is refreshed. When refreshed the app looks for the specific URL in the spring boot app  
And if it's not handled in the spring boot app it will redirect to error page
The hash will be added to the URL
Part of the URL after the hash will be used in the React app for routing
